# CapstoneProject
This was a year long project for my computer science capstone class (CSC 495/496).
I worked in a group of 3, and I mostly focused on UI stuff.
We participated in the academic symposium with this project and won first place in the computer science portion.
This repository is copied from the school one we were using for this project.
